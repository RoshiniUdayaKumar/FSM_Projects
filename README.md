# FSM_Projects
This repository consists of FSM designs. 
I aimed to design two models of FSM- Melay and Moore. 
Melay machines are those whose outputs depend both on the present input and previous state outputs. 
Moore machines are those whose output depends solely on the present input. 
Again these machines can have non-overlapping or overlapping designs. 

FSM projects:
1. Sequence Detector using Moore Non-Overlapping method. 
2. Sequence Detector using Moore Overlapping method.
3. Sequence Detector using Melay Overlapping method.
4. FSM Secure Car Key
5. FSM of a traffic light controller.
6. FSM of a vending machine.
